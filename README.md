# Window Display
Created a window display using C++ in conjunction with the SDL2 library. 

The following outcomes were met through exploring the SDL2 library:

- Developed a basic window display
- Changed color of background surface
- Formulated a function to limit FPS 
- Created a Sprite Class and Sprite Groups
- Loaded BMP images using inherited SDL libraries
- Loaded images of other formats using SDL_image 2.0

The code was developed using John Hammond's "C++ SDL Tutorials" on YouTube.
